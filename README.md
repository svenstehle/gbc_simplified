# Gradient Boosted Decision Trees simplified

This repository provides a simplified version of the popular Gradient Boosting algorithm for multi-class classification with Decision Trees implemented in Python.

Its purpose is to allow for better intuition about the GBDT algorithm. It is not suitable for use in experimental or productive code. Educational use only!

You can find the relevant Python code in [src/GBDT_from_scratch.ipynb](https://github.com/svenstehle/gbc_simplified/blob/main/src/GBDT_from_scratch.ipynb)
